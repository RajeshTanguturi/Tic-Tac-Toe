# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game that can be played in the command line interface (CLI). The game supports two-player mode, where two human players can compete against each other, as well as a single-player mode where the player can play against the computer.
## Features
Two-player mode: Two human players can take turns placing their marks (X or O) on the 3x3 grid.
Single-player mode: The player can play against the computer, which uses a simple AI algorithm to make its moves.
Command-line interface: The game is played entirely in the command line, providing a text-based interface for the players.
Clear game board: The game board is displayed after each move, showing the current state of the game.
Winner detection: The game automatically detects when a player has won or if the game ends in a tie.
## Usage
To play the game, follow these steps:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
Run the Python script using the following command:
python TicTacToe.py

Choose the game mode (two-player or single-player) when prompted.
Follow the on-screen instructions to make your moves by entering the corresponding row and column numbers.
The game will continue until a winner is determined or the game ends in a tie.
